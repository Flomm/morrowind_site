        <p class="paragraph">
          The House Indoril's particular Tribunal is Almalexia. To understand
          the Indoril we must understand Tribunate law, which is divided into
          two broad categories – the Laws Determined and the Laws Ordained.
          Ordained laws are the laws which can be broken, and which it is our
          moral responsibility not to break; it is the role of the Temple (and
          the ordinators, which literally means “those who ordain”) to guide us
          in these laws and to punish those who violate them. Determined laws
          are those laws which we cannot break, those which, by the will of the
          Tribunal, just are. These mean things like the laws of nature but also
          things like social hierarchies and precedences that we think can be
          changed, but in the Indoril worldview are inviolable. Things like
          slavery. The Indoril are therefore all about governance of society and
          the maintenance of law and order. They are a society of regulators. It
          is also a house in which actions are highly ritualized. Deviations
          from the Laws Determined are rigorously corrected and denied as
          incoherent. For example: the route along a pilgrimage requires
          crossing a particular bridge. The bridge has collapsed. Pilgrims
          continue to cross it – those who can levitate do, those who can't die.
          Maybe that's extreme, but that's the idea: determined law cannot be
          wrong, its a contradiction in terms. That said, there is a great deal
          of interpretation in understanding what determined law actually
          dictates, especially now that the Tribunal do not make appearances in
          public. Many of the houses of Morrowind are organized in a manner
          which is not egalitarian but is at least a certain kind of
          corporatism. The House is the society, it has all of its organs, from
          the farmers and laborers to the house-guards, the councillors, the
          wealthy merchants, the vast landowner. For the Indoril, this is not
          so. Indeed, their order is universal – in their minds it does not only
          extend over the people of the lands they directly control, but over
          every other house as well. But that does not make those who labor in
          their fields or craft their materials their kin even in the most
          distant sense that some of the other houses will abide. The Indoril
          are a class above all others, they have been given the sole task of
          governing. The Indoril do not live among the people they rule. They
          live in their chapel-strongholds, dispersed throughout the wilderness
          of their lands or in the great city of the Mourning Hold. The humble
          Velothi towns that dot their lands have no Indoril save the House
          Guards who ensure order; these towns are for the peasants and other
          commoners who do not have kinship to the Tribunal. Thus, there are
          essentially three classes of settlement in the Indoril territories:
          towns filled with non-House-affiliated Dunmer; chapels which belong to
          Indoril lords; and Almalexia, their great metropolitan capital and
          holy city.

        <h2 class="mini_titles">History</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          House Indoril traces its origins to the first Chimer inhabitants of
          Resdayn, in particular a few notable figures that were present in
          Dunmer prehistory, prior to the Red Event (known as the Battle of Red
          Mountain). What would eventually become House Indoril, was once a
          minor clan in Chimer nobility, Indoril Laesa (who would become known
          as Almalexia), being one of its’ members. At some point, Laesa
          eventually became betrothed to Nerevar, a Chimer who claimed to be
          from another minor clan. During the War of the First Council, Nerevar,
          Laesa, and their cohort rose in prominence, through deeds of battle
          throughout the war. During the Battle of Red Mountain, events took a
          drastic turn, and while the details of the Red Event remained murky,
          it became clear that a new social order was to come from these
          occurrences. The Dwemer were eventually defeated, and vanished shortly
          afterward. Nerevar was dead, and the Chimer became the Dunmer.
          However, Laesa (now styling herself as Alma Laesa or Mother Laesa),
          and two of her companions mysteriously retained their appearances,
          proclaiming themselves as the Tribunal, and the rightful rulers of the
          new nation of Morrowind. Shortly after the Proclamation of the
          Tribunal, a particularly zealous and devout group, many of whom had
          previously been the hand-servants, secondary advisors, and
          shield-companions of the Tribunes in Their mortal history, set about
          proselytizing the newly ashened Dunmer and setting the order of
          Morrowind to right. Notable figures among them included Olms, Delyn,
          and Llothis. This group, which included most of the cousins of
          Nerevar, would become the House Indoril. They regarded their actions
          as continuing the goals of the Second Council in keeping the laws of
          Morrowind, and regard Indoril Nerevar as the first leader of their
          house. This house came to dominate Morrowind by virtue of controlling
          the Temple and regulating the law. The Telvanni abandoned the rest of
          Dunmer society, and the Dres operated in stubborn heterodoxy on the
          Deshaan, so both of those houses were largely outside of the Indoril
          sphere. But in the rest of Morrowind, the Redoran guarded the border
          and the Hlaalu mediated Morrowind's relationship with outlanders, but
          the Indoril ruled. However, the Armistice cracked this age-old order.
          It's well-known that many Indoril committed suicide, but the reason is
          not well-understood. Their actions were driven not by stubbornness or
          arrogance so much as confusion; they could not make sense of Morrowind
          losing its independence, for such a development was not consistent
          with determined law. A flurry of exegeses were written to explain the
          Armistice in terms of determined law; these tended to present the
          situation in a way that maintained the Tribunal's total sovereignty
          over Morrowind. Still, it became harder and harder for the Indoril to
          maintain their now mostly theoretical jurisdiction over areas beyond
          their heartland. As the present day approaches, the Indoril must
          confront the biggest challenges they have faced in their history. A
          third of their holy capital is now occupied by outlanders, with the
          presence of an Empire-backed King threatening to finally dismantle
          Indoril hegemony in Morrowind. To the west and south, the Hlaalu,
          emboldened from their gains post-Armistice and adopting an
          expansionist policy, have begun to gobble up the remaining Indoril
          territories around the Thirr River, a major trade route. The Velothi
          in these outlying areas have begun to show less reverence to Indoril
          customs as they become ever more tempted by Hlaalu opportunity. The
          crisis is now at a breaking point, as the Grand Ascendant of House
          Indoril is on his last legs, and has not been seen outside of his
          cloister in months. The unitary theology of the House for the first
          time faces challenges both from within, and without. Tough times face
          Morrowind’s House of rulers, as sweeping upheavals threaten to
          destabilize the very foundations of Morrowind’s society.

        <h2 class="mini_titles">Major settlements</h2>
        <p class="paragraph"></p>
        <p class="cities">
          <b>Almalexia:</b> As the capital city of Morrowind, the Mourning Hold,
          and the seat of Ayem and House Indoril, it lords over the surrounding
          landscape and is of great importance. The High Fane of the Mother
          overlooks a fork in the River Orethan. It is built on stone mesas of
          varying heights, where on which the various districts of the city are
          built upon. It is an embodiment of the social hierarchy established in
          Determined Law, where lower class districts are often built in between
          or underneath the main districts of the city (which surround the High
          Fane). Due to the loss of many Indoril after the Armistice, the
          southern part of the city was left vacant. While the Indoril by law do
          not ever “cede” territory, a large number of outlanders have
          established themselves in these abandoned districts, yet another
          example of how change is beginning to disrupt native hegemony.
          Outlanders sometimes (wrongfully) refer to the city as “Mournhold”.
          The scope of the city is not covered by this document.

        <p class="cities">
          <b>Roa Dyr:</b> Roa Dyr is the Chapel that governs the Thirr River
          Valley and is the largest of the remaining Towers, its influence
          having grown with the loss of other holdings west of the Thirr. It is
          the home of Muther-sil Indoril Draler Ilvi, who has become one of the
          most powerful of Indoril’s Illuminated Elders.
        </p>
        <p class="cities">
          <b>Yed Neyn:</b> Yed Neyn is one of the Chapels that governs a
          significant portion of the Yad Orethan and is the seat of Indoril
          Everi Thanoram It is home to the Sacellum of the Wailing Delve, and a
          secret base for the Adamant Wing, an order of Indoril extremists. It
          is located just east of Almalexia.
        </p>
        <p class="cities">
          <b>Nadhyam:</b> Nadhyam is the holding of Indoril Ienen Salvu, and
          lies on the northern border of the Yad Orethan. Below the chapel is
          the Flowering Temple, a shrine dedicated to the First Toilmer.
        </p>
        <p class="cities">
          <b>Dun Senim:</b> Dun-Senim lords over the Vale of Mephala, and is the
          seat of Indoril Ienen Tomaril. It is highly imposing and one of the
          more fortified chapels in the district. Its’ presence is to establish
          Indoril control over the valley, as well as the Gardens-in-Denial to
          the north (Telvannis). It was rebuilt from the previous chapel at Dun
          Aamul, which was destroyed by cataclysms from the Red Mountain. Due to
          Tomaril being heirless, the chapel and its’ territory will revert to
          family bonestocks, though that hasn’t stopped other Indoril from
          attempting to assert their control over it.
        </p>
        <p class="cities">
          <b>Mol Murya:</b> Mol Murya is the chapel of Orethan’s Mouth, and
          holds dominion over the area surrounding it. It is the largest chapel
          in Av-Orethan In accordance with Ordained Law, it is also the Court of
          the Southern Salt Marches. It is the seat of Indoril Meris Denaven,
          formerly of the Deshaan, who assumed control upon the extinction of a
          greater branch of the family.
        </p>
        <p class="cities">
          <b>Id Vano:</b> Id Vano is the chapel for the Indoril player. Unlike
          other houses, it already exists in Indoril codicies, so it is not
          technically built, but reclaimed by the player. Of course for all
          practical reasons the player must overcome this formality, as no
          structure of the sort exists (it was lost in the Sundering). The
          player will first need to find the site of the long-lost stronghold,
          before establishing a nominal presence somewhere near Vvardenfell
          within the Azurian Straits.

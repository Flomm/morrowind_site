        <h2 class="mini_titles">General information</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The Hlaalu's specific Tribune is Almalexia.
</p><p class="paragraph">
The subtleties of economics do not matter a great deal in the design of video game worlds, but one thing should be understood about the Hlaalu ideology: it is not capitalism. The Hlaalu ideology has much more in common with mercantilism. The Hlaalu seek to profit themselves, the house, and Morrowind through economic activity. They are generally unscrupulous. They use force to set up house-enforced monopolies and economic regimes.
</p><p class="paragraph">
The Hlaalu value personal self-sufficiency & autonomy, ingenuity & entrepreneurship, and cunning. They are playing a game that is bigger and more self-conscious than any other Dunmer. They have no objection to lying, in general.

</p><p class="paragraph">
Hlaalu society is a society of disguises in which things are frequently not as they seem. An open port full of commerce is run by cheating, chauvinistic tongs. A small publican's cornerclub hides a Twin Lamps safehouse in its basement. A shipping magnate carries a fortune in skooma in the hull of his boats. Whatever public face the Hlaalu elite put on, their true goal is their own survival and prosperity.
</p><p class="paragraph">
Great House Hlaalu has continued in its role as the gatekeeper of outside trade. The wealth of the Empire - from Colovian steel to Nibenese moth-silk - must pass through their hands on the way to Morrowind. So too do they export the treasures of Morrowind: Telvanni bugmusk, kwama eggs, racer plumes, saltrice, and more.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mini_titles">History</h2>
         <p class="paragraph">
           After the Annunciation of the Tribunal, while House Redoran set about rebuilding the borders and House Indoril set about generating the theological and judicial governance of Morrowind, many of the other houses set about actually rebuilding Resdayn, after decades of war, the disappearance of a large & economically important minority of the population (the Dwemer), and the ecological damages of the eruption of Red Mountain. Foremost among those who took up mundane matters of rebuilding were the houses of the Othreleth Woods & the upper Thirr, including such houses as Hlaalu & Narsuaes.
</p><p class="paragraph">
These houses were also able to sustain their independence when House Indoril began absorbing other houses into itself following the abolition of the First Council. While initially politically isolated, the absorption of a schismatic part of the Raathim lent legitimacy to their independence, bolstering an economic niche that the Indoril could not match. Said economic niche was their trade connections to Cyrodiil and beyond, including the import of Khajiit slaves traded by Catcatchers, river-going Nedes who harassed the shores of Ne Quin-al during the degenerate periods of the First Empire. The houses found their strength and survival in economics, when political will alone would have easily led to their extinction.
</p><p class="paragraph">
By the Second Era, these houses had coalesced under the leadership of Hlaalu, and were recognized in Dunmer social theology as one of the Great Houses, a worldview that has been anachronistically stretched back to the days of the Chimer. They took on the role of mediating trade with the outside world, and so long as Morrowind was fully independent, they were widely regarded as the least significant house. Historically, the inferior position of Hlaalu in terms of regulating internal trade pushed them towards involvement in markets the Indoril were not willing to involve themselves in; secret trades that went on during house wars out of sight, and then later involvement in the criminal underworld.
</p><p class="paragraph">
However, following the Armistice, which recognized Morrowind's sovereignty while creating a western-style kingdom as an instrument for the Empire’s governance, the Hlaalu's opportunities for power greatly expanded. In narratives of the Indoril, Dres, & Redoran, the Hlaalu have come to be seen as traitors for their relationship with the Empire, including aspersions on their role in the period leading up to the Armistice.
</p><p class="paragraph">
In about 3E 425, political maneuvering led to the replacement of the Chancellor of House Hlaalu. Previously, this position had always been held by members of the personal Hlaalu family, a status that no other Great House had maintained. The new leader, a self-made woman, is visionary, brilliant, and cutthroat, and is playing the other actors of Morrowind like chumps for the betterment of herself & her house.
         </p>
         <h2 class="mini_titles">Settlements</h2>
         <p class="paragraph">
           Hlaalu's major settlements are usually large cities centered around trade and industry, often with large public spaces and holdings of private enterprise. They often have council clubs and various guildhalls for players looking for work. Broad boulevards and streets form the central arteries, and are relatively easy to navigate, containing the majority of the settlement's businesses and guildhalls. Upscale Manor districts are usually also found to house the dwellings of Hlaalu officials and structures related to the local administration. Side streets and back alleys behind structures are sometimes labyrinthian and harbour a seedier side of Hlaalu society. Some may even be dangerous for the player.

Plantation-estates are often found in the countryside and are usually owned by members of the Hlaalu peerage. The largest of these estates usually are owned by Council-Electors of the Hlaalu Council Company, and usually contain auxiliary structures for plantation workers and slaves. The largest of these estates should have some self-sufficiency.

Smaller towns and villages in Hlaalu territory are numerous and often constitute local trade nodes, or ports. These usually only consist of a few structures which house local workers and tradesmer. Some also contain auxiliary housing for those in charge of these settlement spaces.
</p><p class="paragraph">
<b>Narsis:</b> Narsis is the ancient clanstead of House Hlaalu. Prior to the creation of the house, Narsis was already an important outpost in which the Hlaalu family maintained trade relations with outsiders. Over the years it has grown to be one of the largest and most powerful cities in Morrowind. It is a large city, deserving of its own section and documents.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<b>Kragen Mar:</b> Once a Redoran outpost, Kragen Mar is a large trade town on the border with Cyrodiil. It is the nexus of cross-border trade in Morrowind. Control over the lucrative trade in Colovian goods is a key aspect of the city's intrigue, and there are many shops and guilds that compete over the production of goods and services. It has the second-largest population of outlanders in the entire province.
</p><p class="paragraph">
<b>Andothren:</b> Andothren is a mid-sized port town on the Inner Sea. It was once a Velothi settlement under Indoril rule before the Hlaalu sacked and rebuilt it as the city of Andothren. Some outlanders refer to the city as “Stonefalls”, though that name has fallen out of favour in recent years, even amongst outsiders. It's location and proximity to Vvardenfell make its location strategically important for goods coming in and out of Vvardenfell, as well as an important port for agricultural goods coming up from Southern Morrowind. In-game, it fills the role Balmora previously had as the player's “first city”.

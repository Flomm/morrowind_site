        <h2 class="mini_titles">General information</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
    The House Dres’ particular Tribunal is Sotha Sil.     
</p><p class="paragraph">
Dres itself is a confederation of semi-nomadic clans that settled the Deshaan in ages past. Their public ruling body, the Covenant Council, is made up of representatives from the various clans which have retained their distinct identities, unlike the other houses. Over time, some of the clans have come under the authority of (or have become indebted to) other clans. Leadership of House Dres appears to rest in the office of the satchem-ithil, who heads the Covenant Council, though the truth, as always, is more complex.
</p><p class="paragraph">
Their society is one without generosity. They are xenophobic, unfriendly, and stern. More so than other houses, the Dres are taciturn and unapproachable. Even rather insignificant things are considered hard-won knowledge that can only be shared within the Great House, or even vassal minor clan. The Dres consider other Dunmer outside their society as misguided, while outlanders are not even recognized as sentient beings worthy of consideration.

</p><p class="paragraph">
The Dres have a deep-seated belief in their traditions, which are more ancient than those of any other Great House. They are distrustful of change and new customs. Despite their staunch traditionalism and adherence to ancient, tribalistic customs (similar to those of the Ashlanders), they are still a sophisticated industrial and agricultural powerhouse, exporting food and slaves to the rest of Morrowind. They value hard work, and though their success has largely come as a result of shameful dealings, they regard it as the result of effort and sacrifice on their part. They do not indulge themselves like the Indoril & Hlaalu do.
</p><p class="paragraph">
Economically, the house depends on the cultivation and export of saltrice, utilizing a large pool of slaves to power the machinery that makes the Deshaan Plains the breadbasket of Morrowind. They trade only at the edges of their society (and territory), and don’t let outsiders in or travel out themselves. Making and getting good bargains (both within the society and without) is essential to their identity, without regard to the concepts of fairness.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mini_titles">History</h2>
         <p class="paragraph">
   House Dres traces its origins to the Cantemiric Velothi, a nomadic collection of clans that moved into the hostile Deshaan Forests and subsided on slash-and-char agriculture before moving on.        
</p><p class="paragraph">
In their wake came the Saltwalkers, Chimeri nomads who eked out a living herding fauna. Before the eruption of Red Mountain desolated the great forests, they often lived in close relationship to the Cantemirics. Afterwards, the Saltwalkers held court in the ruins of Cantemiric civilisation while those moved beyond the Salt Marshes into Argonia.
</p><p class="paragraph">
After the War of the First Council, the Annunciation of the Tribunal was interpreted differently by different houses. In the south, around the Deshaan and on the southeastern coast, the predominant local variation of the Tribunal faith would become a heterodox tradition once the Indoril theology became accepted as the universal orthodoxy. These schismatics regard the Tribunal as the Realization of the Good Daedra, rather than seeing the Good Daedra as the Anticipations of the Tribunal. They accept the Tribunals' divinity, but in a way which maintains an equality with (or possibly a certain inferiority to) Daedra, rather than holding the Tribunal to be the greatest and most mighty divinity imaginable. The Dres view saints as heroes rather than revere them as holy beings. They maintain different burial rites and records of ancestry from those of the north, and did not send dead to Necrom until the Tribunal required it for the Ghostfence (which remains a controversial point). 
</p><p class="paragraph">
At first, the Dres relied on Hlaalu slaves brought from Elsweyr for the majority of their labor force. During the Middle Dawn, however, Dres leaders made a secret trade deal with the Hist, one which would be their downfall if it was discovered. They traded a small number of Dunmer to the Hist in exchange for a huge amount of Argonian slaves. Things almost came to a head in the Arnesian War, when one of the Dunmer thus traded attempted to escape, but for now the Dres have kept a lid on the externalities of their deals with the Hist.

         <h2 class="mini_titles">Settlements</h2>
         <p class="paragraph">
           The Dres have two major settlements, Tear, and Dres Horak, which are found at the eastern and western peripheries of their territory respectively. Though Tear is the largest city in Dres territory, it is truly more of a slave market that the Dres set up for the sole purpose of trading with outsiders (including the Dunmer of House Telvanni). Unscrupulous traders of all races can often be found in Tear, as it’s geographical location offers relative isolation from the laws and regulations of the Empire. The Dres themselves view Tear with no small amount of disdain.

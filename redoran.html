        <p class="paragraph">
          House Redoran's particular Tribunal is Vivec.
</p><p class="paragraph">
Understanding House Redoran is to understand complex warrior-societies within the context of Morrowind’s social framework. They are the guardians of Morrowind. Like most of the other Houses of Morrowind, House Redoran embodies their society. In the case of Redoran, the values of kinship and deed closely are intertwined into the fabric of everyday life, and ones that ultimately define their worldview.
</p><p class="paragraph">
It’s easy to generalize the Redoran as simply being warriors and defenders, when indeed this is not the case. Primarily speaking, Redoran culture is dominated by the concept of fictive-kinship, in which kinship is derived from one’s deeds and values, rather than that of consanguinity. Familal-ties form the backbone of Redoran society, so much so that one’s clan is a badge of honour in itself. The shield is a honeycomb, woven through ages of deeds and sacrifices immortalized in the collective wisdom of the many clans that form House Redoran. The rituals of the various clans are rooted deep in oral and written traditions, passed along the generations, and can vary between different communities.

</p><p class="paragraph">
The strongest and of these clans martial other lesser clans into three distinct “marches” that oversee the large swathes of territory that form Morrowind’s western border. In the north lies the Ashes-march, that traditionally encompasses Morrowind’s border with Skyrim, including the badlands of the Julan-Shar, and the Grey Meadows. Further south is the Stones-march, consisting the rocky valleys of the Roth Roryn and the Clambering Moor. The southernmost march is the Waters-march, which once guarded the strategic waterways of the Thirr and Othreleth. Each has its own homestead, which contains a council hall. Each march has its own council, made up of the patriarchs and matriarchs of great families. The members of the council all have unique, militial titles which together create an image of Dunmer war tactics. The leader of the council of each March is called the Crab-Chief. In times of war, the greatest of these crab-chiefs gathers at the Skar-Home to form the Redoran War Council. There, they elect their Hortator who serves as head of House.
</p><p class="paragraph">
Outside Baan Malur and the march-homes, other Redoran mostly live in clansteads that dot the various marches, living amongst the people they protect. Redoran are not individualists, but they are locally oriented and provincial compared to the House Indoril. They tend to conceptualize the House Redoran in terms of their immediate family and community rather than the House at large. More regarding their particular character tropes is described later in this document.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mini_titles">History</h2>
         <p class="paragraph">
           Like all great houses, House Redoran traces its origins to the First Council. It regards itself as the continuity of the Council in matters of war and the defense of Morrowind, the Dunmer and the Tribunal (who, as sovereign dieties, are Morrowind and are the Dunmer). The House's Crab-Chiefs and War Councillors elect a Hortator to lead them in matters of war, and they therefore regard Indoril Nerevar as the first head of house.
</p><p class="paragraph">
During the Battle of Red Mountain, the members of the Second Council who became the fathers of Redoran came into battle on great war crabs, the greatest of which was the Skar, which died during the battle on the western slopes of the mountain. After the battle and after the proclamation of the Tribunal, the Redoran returned to the Skar to have their first council after the death of Nerevar. There, some who supported Sul Alandro split off, along with others from other old houses, and became the Ashlanders, while the rest formed what would eventually become the Great House Redoran. Over time, it took the form described on the previous page.
</p><p class="paragraph">
Late in the end of the Second Era, the Tribunal closed Morrowind except for the holy sites. Redoran's only presence on Vvardenfell thereafter was protecting the Ash Face of Vivec at Gnisis. They dragged the body of the Skar to the mainland and put it either in the heart of Baan Malur. Since the rise of Dagoth Ur and the construction of the Ghostfence, the Redoran have consistently elected a Hortator as they continue to be at war with an active enemy.
</p><p class="paragraph">
When Vivec re-opened Vvardenfell, the current Hortator Bolvyn Venim managed to secure for House Redoran a considerable portion of the land in Vvardenfell, where several settlements have since been built. They moved the Skar back to Vvardenfell, dragging it overland with hooms and floating it over water, guided by lampskates. The Skar is very buoyant because it is a crab exoskeleton.
</p><p class="paragraph">
Nowadays, Bolvyn Venim and the War Council are face-to-face with Dagoth Ur, but have devised no way of halting his advance. Venim is essentially, and at some level consciously, on a suicide mission to Vvardenfell, with the Scarab-Chiefs of each Redoran March with him. The House Redoran is floundering without guidance or leadership.
         </p>
         <h2 class="mini_titles">Settlements</h2>
         <p class="paragraph">
           With such a decentralized population, it was only natural for pre-Tribunal clans to set up meeting places where they could engage in inter-clan politics, including duels. These meeting places grew in importance as the Redoran became more unified, starting from around the time of the First Council: the meetings became increasingly common until permanent councils were established, and those councils gained in power and influence. To reflect that, Redoran warriors started to build huts around the council houses, so as to be able to protect them from threats.

As such, at  their core, Redoran cities are actually strongholds which are supplied from outlying Redoran settlements. While commoners do live in the cities, they overwhelmingly belong to minorities, such as former outlanders and non-Dunmer. Due to the frequent dust bowls that were endemic in the ash wastes and desert badlands of Western Morrowind, Redoran architecture is uniquely shaped to weather harsh conditions, adapting the organic forms of bugshells and appropriating the shells of other indigenous anthropods as their dwellings.
</p><p class="paragraph">
<b>Major Cities:</b> The only true city of House Redoran is at Baan Malur. It is large because of its’ location of millitary significance, as well as its’ importance as the place where Redoran conduct affairs of state. It is also home to the region’s only Arena, which functions as a court of last-resort, where Redoran families often travel to settle disputes that cannot be settled in local or march councils.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<b>March-hives:</b> March-hives, or March Capitals, are the marshaling points in which armies from the local marches gather. They are substantive settlements in their own right, and provide support to the Marches-at-War. Many families live in these settlements, and they always feature the council hall that manages local affairs.
</p><p class="paragraph">
<b>Clansteads:</b> Smaller towns and villages in outlying areas that provide support and garrison in more remote areas.
